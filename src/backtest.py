"""
Out-of-sample backtest.

At each rebalancing date we estimate returns and risk on the PAST 60 months only and compute
new weights. Between two rebalancings we hold the portfolio, so the weights drift with the
markets. We never use future information.

Transaction costs, as in lecture LN3:
  - every trade costs `cost` (e.g. 0.10% of the amount traded), paid from the portfolio;
  - Mean-variance and Black-Litterman can be "cost-aware": they solve the LN3 problem with
    transaction costs, so they only trade when it is worth it;
  - the turnover of each rebalancing can be limited (LN3 turnover management).
